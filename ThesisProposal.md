#### Designer Project Dashboard

Graphic Design is a field that isn’t just about making pretty images, but rather about being able to effectively communicate your ideas with one another using images, words, textures, etc. One of the biggest problems that I personally face with design is poor communication, not with the viewers, but the clients. Every iteration ends with a 50+ email thread with tens of different documents each harboring a minuscule change. Working with a team is worse because everyone works on their documents, meaning that if you need to take on a project, you are giving their project folder with no explanation on what else needs to be done.

To try and fix this problem, I began looking at different software to help me with my future endeavors. Many applications were great at keeping track of tasks, but that was the limit of their capabilities. It didn’t feel like a part of the process but rather an unnecessary step. My goal is to take the design process into account and develop an application that creators can use to boost team communication throughout the design process, from ideation to presentation.

Some of the features that I am looking to develop are the following:


- Calendar
    - Tracks all upcoming deadlines
    - Generate weekly summaries based on what's upcoming and what has been completed
- A “plate” of the tasks/projects of each team member
- A way to delegate and pick up tasks from other members shown they need it
- A semi-version control system (think github)
    - Displays history of changes made to the project
    - Upload both deliverables and native files for easy accessibility
    - A way to comment on projects, giving immediate feedback without needing to send an email to the team member.
- Direct messaging between team members, separating work from private life.

Technical Analysis:

Front End: Javascript (React)
Back End: Python, Java
Database: MySQL

APIs: Google Workspace

In Depth:

Javascript - Javascript has plenty of frameworks that can be used for setting up the server of the application, not to mention its ability to make web pages interactive.

Java - Java has been used on the backend for plenty of applications in the enterprise level, especially desktop applications

Python - One of the most popular programming languages of the modern day, I want to learn more about the language and this seems like the perfect project to do so

MySQL - This is the database query language that I am the most familiar with.
